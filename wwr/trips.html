              <p>White water rafting in Peru on the Rio Cotahuasi is our most exciting expedition to date, this is an adventure for experienced rafters looking for the ultimate white-water challenge. The Rio Cotahuasi is a relatively new white-water discovery; its first descent was not until 1994 and is surely one of the last remaining secrets in the rafting world. 
                A remote river consisting of world-class rapids, spectacular campsites and unexplored archaeological ruins all set in a breathtakingly beautiful canyon, declared the “World’s Deepest Canyon”. This is not a trip for the faint-hearted. It begins high up on the Altiplano for a drive into the river, through remote villages and past spectacular volcanoes. </p>
